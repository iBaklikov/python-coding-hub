    " Delete Instance Attributes with del\n",
    "You can delete an instance attribute with the keyword del followed by a space, the instance, a dot, and the name of the attribute that will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "del <instance>.<attribute>\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove the instance attribute name from a dog instance, you would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "del dog.name\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "‚óºÔ∏è Example\n",
    "Let's see a more detailed example with the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define a Dog class:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    " \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "       self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we create an instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Nora\")\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we check if this instance has a name instance attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.name)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "'Nora'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's delete the name attribute from the dog instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "del dog.name\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we check the value of the name attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.name)\n",
    "\n",
    "We get this error:\n",
    "\n",
    "AttributeError: 'Dog' object has no attribute 'name'\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message confirms that the object does not have this attribute (name).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° Tip: With del, we can only use a fixed value for the name of the attribute that we write after the dot in the dot notation. This means that we cannot delete an attribute dynamically based on the value of a variable.\n",

    " Delete Instance Attributes with delattr\n",
